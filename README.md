Welcome to my Python Projects repository! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently learning Python and using this space to build small projects as I grow my skills â€” one step at a time.

These projects are not perfect â€” in fact, thatâ€™s the point.
I'm learning by doing, experimenting with ideas, and improving through feedback.

ðŸ’¡ If you have suggestions, advice, or corrections â€” I would love your help!
ðŸ“Œ Whether itâ€™s fixing something, improving code structure, or simply sharing tips, every bit of guidance is appreciated.
